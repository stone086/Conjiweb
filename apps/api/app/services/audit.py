audit.py — Audit logging helper.

Audit events are durable, after-the-fact records of security-significant
actions (logins, role changes, account lifecycle, webhook lifecycle, etc).
They go to PostgreSQL, NOT structured logs, because audit logs need to:
  - Survive log-rotation / log-retention policies that delete normal logs
  - Be queryable from the admin panel via /admin/audit-logs
  - Have integrity (you can ALTER LOG-FILE permissions; you can't ALTER
    PostgreSQL rows without leaving traces in the WAL)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. Best-effort. If audit write fails (DB down, table missing on a fresh
   install before migration), log a warning to the structured log and
   continue. NEVER let an audit failure block the user-facing action it
   was logging — that turns audit logging into an availability bug.

2. PII-aware. The `detail` dict is filtered before write:
   - IP addresses have their last octet masked (192.168.1.200 → 192.168.1.0/24).
     This preserves enough info for forensics ("which subnet?") while
     reducing the GDPR exposure of storing exact user IPs forever.
   - Known sensitive keys (password, token, secret, key, authorization,
     cookie) are redacted to "***" — even if a caller accidentally passes
     a password through the audit detail.
   - String values >2KB are truncated; nested dicts beyond depth 4 are
     dropped. Audit detail is for forensics, not data archival.

3. Caller-friendly. Pass `actor`, `action`, optional target + detail.
   No need to manage commits — we open our own short transaction.

    """Extract the caller's IP, trusting only what nginx sets directly.

    THE TRAP: `X-Forwarded-For` is APPENDED-to by nginx, not replaced.
    When a client sends `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4` and connects from
    5.6.7.8, the FastAPI app sees `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8`.
    Taking index [0] gives the attacker-supplied value — they can spoof
    audit log IPs, rate-limit keys, and any log line referencing client IP.

    THE FIX: trust `X-Real-IP` instead. nginx sets it explicitly to
    `$remote_addr`, the actual TCP source — clients can't forge that
    because nginx doesn't pass through the client-supplied X-Real-IP.
    Falls back to `request.client.host` only when X-Real-IP is absent
    (running behind a different proxy or directly without nginx).

    If you ever stack a CDN in front of nginx (Cloudflare, Fastly), set
    `set_real_ip_from <CDN-network>;` and `real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;`
    in nginx so X-Real-IP reflects the actual client behind the CDN —
    DON'T parse X-Forwarded-For yourself in app code.
