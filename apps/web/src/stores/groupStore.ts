/**
 * groupStore — Tracks MUC (XEP-0045) rooms per account.
 *
 * Source-of-truth distinction:
 *   - `joinState: "idle"`     — room is known (e.g. invite received, public
 *                               directory hit) but we are NOT a member
 *   - `joinState: "joining"`  — join presence sent, awaiting server confirmation
 *   - `joinState: "joined"`   — server confirmed via self-presence (status 110)
 *   - `joinState: "kicked"`   — server removed us (kick / ban / shutdown)
 *   - `joinState: "destroyed"` — room was destroyed
 *   - `joinState: "error"`    — last join attempt failed
 *
 * The previous schema had a single `joined: boolean` flag that the UI
 * flipped immediately on `joinRoom()` call, leading to "frontend has the
 * group but the backend has no room" ghost states. The new state machine
 * is driven entirely by server events; the UI MUST NOT mutate joinState
 * directly.
 *
 * Storage key: `${accountId}::${roomJid}` so the same room joined from
 * two accounts (different nicknames, different join states) doesn't collide.
