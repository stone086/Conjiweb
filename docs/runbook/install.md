# Conjiweb Install Runbook

Version: 2.2.0 ops-runbook

Use this runbook for a clean staging or production install. Do not skip staging for new releases.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Fresh Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 VM.
- DNS `A/AAAA` record already points to the server.
- Ports 80 and 443 are reachable from the internet.

- A release zip that has passed `scripts/stage0_validate.sh --local`.

## 2. Preflight

```

Confirm DNS resolves to this VM before running the installer.

```

Record the one-time admin password printed by the installer and store it in a password manager.

sudo nginx -t
sudo prosodyctl check config
sudo systemctl status conjiweb-api prosody nginx minio --no-pager
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
