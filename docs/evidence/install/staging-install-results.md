# Staging Fresh Install Results

Status: PASS_AFTER_HASH_LOCK_REPAIR

Target: `https://staging.example.com`

Run date: 2026-05-13

## Summary

`bash install.sh --run-local --ssh-port 22` completed on staging after repairing
the Python hash lock for Ubuntu 22.04 / CPython 3.10 wheels.

The first install attempt failed during backend dependency installation because
`apps/api/requirements.txt` was generated for CPython 3.13 Linux wheels while
staging uses Ubuntu 22.04 system Python 3.10. The repaired lock file was pulled
back into the repository as `apps/api/requirements.txt`.
